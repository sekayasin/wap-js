Question 2
1. Explain why do we want sometimes to use setImmediate instead of using setTimeout?
-> setTimeout schedules a callback to run after a specific time, it runs in the timer phase. 
-> setImmediate schedules a callback to run at check phase after I/O events callbacks. 
-> If there is case that needs to run just before close phase, we use setImmediate.

2. Explain the difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate?
-> setImmediate schedules a callback to run at check phase of the event loop after I/O events callbacks. 
-> process.nextTick is not part of the event loop, it adds the callback into the nextTick queue. 

-> process.nextTick API is provided natively by Nodejs.
-> setImmediate provided by libuv

-> callback of process.nextTick get executed multiple chances in one iteration - highest priority
-> setImmediate only get executed once in one cycle.

-> how many callbacks will be executed in one iteration? 
process.nextTick() - all of callbacks in nextTick queue, drain out - Don't use while true loop on process.nextTick, will block event loop. 
setImmediate - certain, the remaining for next iteration/tick


3. Does Node.js has window object?
-> No
